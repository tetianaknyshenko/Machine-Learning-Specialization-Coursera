Question 1

For linear regression, the model is 
f
w
,
b
(
x
)
=
w
x
+
b
f 
w,b
​
 (x)=wx+b.


Which of the following are the inputs, or features, that are fed into the model and with which the model is expected to make a prediction?


w
w and 
b
b.



(
x
,
y
)
(x,y) 



x
x



m
m


Correct
The 
x
x, the input features, are fed into the model to generate a prediction 
f
w
,
b
(
x
)
f 
w,b
​
 (x)

Question 2
For linear regression, if you find parameters 
w
w and 
b
b so that 
J
(
w
,
b
)
J(w,b) is very close to zero, what can you conclude?


This is never possible -- there must be a bug in the code. 



The selected values of the parameters 
w
w and 
b
b cause the algorithm to fit the training set really well.



The selected values of the parameters 
w
w and 
b
b cause the algorithm to fit the training set really poorly.


Correct
When the cost is small, this means that the model fits the training set well.
